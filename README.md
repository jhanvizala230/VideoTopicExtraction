# üé• Video Topic Extraction and Visualization

## üìå Project Description

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing video content. It covers:
- Transcribing spoken content from video files.
- Normalizing and cleaning the text data.
- Extracting key phrases and relevant topics.
- Visualizing the extracted topics with an interactive dashboard.

This workflow is useful for automatic topic discovery, content summarization, and data-driven insights from recorded videos.

## üßÆ Algorithms Used & Description

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Speech-to-Text Transcription  
**Tool:** `SpeechRecognition` + Google Speech API  
**Description:** Extracts audio from videos and splits it into 1-minute segments. Each segment is sent to the Google API to produce a transcript.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Normalization  
**Tools:** `nltk`  
**Description:**  
- Lowercasing  
- Removing punctuation  
- Removing stopwords  
- Tokenization  
- Lemmatization (reduces words to their base form)

This cleans the raw transcript and makes it suitable for NLP tasks.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Keyphrase Extraction  
**Tool:** `KeyBERT`  
**Description:** Uses BERT embeddings to find phrases and words that capture the main ideas in the text. Works by ranking n-grams by semantic similarity to the document.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Topic Modeling  
**Tool:** `Gensim LDA`  
**Description:**  
- Transforms text into bag-of-words representation.
- Builds bigrams to capture common phrases.
- Trains a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover hidden topics in the text corpus.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Visualization  
**Tool:** `pyLDAvis`  
**Description:** Generates an HTML dashboard that lets you explore:
- Topic distribution


### The interactive pyLDAvis dashboard shows an intertopic distance map and the key words defining each topic. Well-separated bubbles indicate distinct topics, and the term bars help interpret the top keywords for each topic. The lambda slider fine-tunes how generic vs unique words are shown
