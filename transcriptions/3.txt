there's been a lot of hype about neural networks and perhaps some of that hype is Justified given how well they're working but it turns out that so far almost all the economic value created by a new network has been through one type of machine learning called supervisor learning let's see what that means and let's go for some examples in supervised learning you have some input X and you want to learn the functioning to some output why so for example just now we sold the housing price prediction application where you put some features of a home and try to Output or estimate the price why here are some other examples that neural networks have been applied to very effectively possibly the single most lucrative application of deep learning today is online advertising of maybe not the most inspiring but certainly very lucrative in which by implanting and add information about add to the website is thinking of showing you and some information about the user neural networks have gotten very good at predicting whether or not you click on that and by showing you and showing users the ads that you're most likely to click on this has been an incredibly lucrative application of neural networks and multiple companies because the ability to show you as the you more likely to click on as a direct impact on the bottom line of some of the very large online advertising companies computer vision has also made huge strides in the last several years mostly due to deep learning so you might even image and one to output and index say from one to 1000 trying to tell you if this picture might be any one of say a thousand different images so you might use that for the tagging I think the recent Progressive recognition has also been very exciting when you can now input an audio clip to your network machine translation has also made huge strides thanks to deep learning right now you can have a new network into the English sentence and directly output the Chinese sentence and in autonomous driving you might input an image say a picture of what's in front of your car as well as some information from a radar and based on that maybe on your network can be trained to tell you the position of the other calls on the road so just becomes a key component in autonomous Driving Systems so a lot of the value creation through new networks has been through your cleverly selecting what should be exact and what should be why for your particular problem and then 15 the supervised learning components into often a bigger system such as an autonomous vehicle it turns out that slightly different types of neural networks are useful for different applications for example in the real estate application that we saw in the architecture and maybe for real estate and online advertising might be a relatively standard new network like like the one that we saw for image applications will often use convolutional neural networks of an abbreviated CNN and for sequence data so for example audio has a temperature is most naturally represented as a one-dimensional Time series was a one-dimensional temporal sequence and so for sequence data you often use an RNN or recurrent units work language you know English in Chinese the alphabet is the worst in the time so language is also most naturally represented as sequence data and so more complex versions of rnns are often used for these applications and then for a more complex applications like autonomous driving when you have an image that might suggest more of a CNN convolutional neural structure and radar info which is you know something something quite different you might end up with more customers or some more complex hybrid neural network architecture so just a bit more concrete about what are the standard CNN and RNN architectures so in the literature you might have seen pictures like this so that's a standard units you might have seen pictures like this this is an example of a convolutional neural network and we'll see in a later cause exactly what this picture means and how you can implement this but conclusion networks are often used for and you must have seen pictures like this and you learn how to implement this later course on your very good for this type of one-dimensional right sequence data that is a maybe a temporal component you might also have heard about applications of machine learning to both structured data and unstructured data here's what determines mean structured data means basically you know databases of data so for example in housing price prediction you might have a database with a column that tells you the size of the number of bedrooms so this is structured data or you know in predicting whether or not a usable click on an ad you might have information about the user such as they age and then labels why you trying to protect so that's structured data meaning that each of the features such as size of a house on their bedrooms or the age of user has a very well defined meaning in contrast unstructured data refers to things like audio or audio images for you might want to recognize was in the image or text here are the features might be the pixel values in an image or the individual words in a piece of text historically it's been much harder for computers to make sense of unstructured data compared to structured data and the fact that the human race has evolved to be very good at understanding audio cues as was images and then text was a more recent invention but people are just really good at interpreting unstructured data and so one of the most exciting things about the rise of neural networks is that thanks to deep learning thanks to neural networks computers are now much better and interpreting unstructured data as well compared to just a few years ago and this creates opportunities for many new exciting applications that you speak recognition image recognition natural language processing on text much more than was possible even just two or three years ago I think because people have a natural empathy to understand the unstructured data you might hear about neural network successes on unstructured data more in the media because it's just cool when the new network recognizes a cat we all like that and we all know what that means but it turns out that a lot of the short-term economic value that new networks are creating has also been on structured data such as much better advertising systems much better probably recommendations and just a much better ability to process the giant databases that many companies have to make accurate predictions from them so in this course a lot of the techniques will go over will apply to both structured data and to instruction data for the purposes of explaining the albums we would draw a little bit more on examples that you use unstructured data but as you think through applications of neural networks within your own team I hope you find both uses for them in both structures and unstructured data so new networks have transformed supervised learning and are creating tremendous economic value it turns out though that the basic technical ideas behind your networks have most even around sometimes for many decades so why is it then that they're only just now taking off and working so well in the next video we'll talk about why is only quite recently than your natural to that
